# Cloudinary Integration Summary

## âœ… Complete Cloudinary Integration

Your Akamba Handicraft application now uses Cloudinary consistently throughout the entire system for both development and production environments.

## ðŸ”§ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Upload API Updated** (`/app/api/admin/upload/route.ts`)
